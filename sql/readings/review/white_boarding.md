# White Boarding

Now you and your partner will get the chance to deepen your understanding of
algorithms by participating in a programming tradition: white boarding! **NO
CODE WILL BE RUN** during this white boarding session. All code for this
exercise should be written on an actual whiteboard or in a text file. The point
of white boarding is testing not simply if you can write code, but if you can
**understand** code.

Both partners will receive a set of questions and solutions for those questions.
Partner A will switch off with Partner B asking one question at a time. The
partner currently answering the question will make every attempt to answer the
question while explaining their thought process. The other partner will only
offer hints at a solution once the person answering has gotten completely stuck.

You'll find that having to explain the code you write will further deepen your
understanding of that code. The solution either partner comes up with will
probably be different than the provided solution and that is totally fine! Both
partners can choose to go back and refactor the code they've written after all
questions have been answered.

**Don't spend longer than 20 minutes per coding question.** Start a timer once
the question has finished being read.

[Here][wb] are the files for Partner A and Partner B - choose a role and Partner
A will be the first one to be asked a question.

Happy boarding!!
