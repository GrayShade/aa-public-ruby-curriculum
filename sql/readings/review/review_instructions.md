## Review Day!

Today you'll have a chance to review everything you've learned in the course so
far. This day will be broken up into two primary parts:

### Paired:

1. WhiteBoarding

### Solo:

2. Project Review (Polls App)

## Whiteboarding
This is a pairing project, with each member of the pair taking turns answering
a question. Read through the instructions carefully to ensure you get the full
benefit of this exercise!

## Project Review (Polls App)
You will select any project from last week and attempt it **solo**. We recommend
Polls App, the 2nd project from W5D5. A lot of students don't even get to this 
project on W5D5, so it is a great way to review all the concepts you learned
last week.

Start your chosen project from the beginning. Working on this project solo
will ensure that you really understand each phase of the project. 

### _**Reminder**_
Ask your instructors plenty of questions to make sure you understand all the 
elements of the project you've chosen. This is your review day, so get the 
most out of it!
