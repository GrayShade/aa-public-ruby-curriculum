## Implicit Bias Flex

Tomorrow we will be talking about implicit bias: what it is, how to catch it,
and how to ensure that we aren't allowing our biases to impact our interactions
negatively. 

## Learning Objectives 
1. Define implicit bias and identify examples.
2. Analyze the impact of implicit bias on the workplace and at a/A. 
3. Develop a plan for addressing implicit bias, micro-aggressions, and
   aggression at a/A.
