## Notes

JavaScript is the fourth module in the App Academy Full Stack Developer
Curriculum. The JavaScript module will have one assessment on W9D2, where you
will be able to track your progress and understanding of the material.

As with all future modules, any "Bonus" projects are to be completed after all
the standard projects for each day are completed. Sometimes that could mean
going back to a previous day's "Bonus" project(s) if you finish a day's material
early.

Additional Resources are readings, videos, or articles that are not required but
will serve to deepen your understanding of a topic. They will be explicitly
denoted in your task menu.
