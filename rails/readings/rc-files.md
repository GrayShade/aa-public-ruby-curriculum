# RC Files

You may recall adding commands to a __.bashrc__ or __.zshrc__ when you were
setting up your shell environment. (If not, that's okay!) The `rc` at the end of
the filenames stands for "run commands". Not surprisingly, then, `rc` files
contain commands that will be executed when the associated program is run.

This reading will show you how to use `rc` files to specify a default set of
options to use with `rails new`.

## Using __~/.railsrc__ to set default options for a new Rails app

In this course, you almost always add the same three or four flags when creating
a new Rails project:

```sh
rails new my-app -T --minimal -d=postgresql
```

(and often `-G`).

When you have a standard setup for creating Rails projects, you can save time by
storing that setup in a __.railsrc__ file in your home directory. For instance,
for App Academy, you might put the following in your __~/.railsrc__ file:

```sh
# ~/.railsrc

-T
--minimal
-d=postgresql
```

When you create a new Rails app, Rails will read the options specified in
__~/.railsrc__ and add them to any options specified on the command line. So,
for example, if you have set up your __~/.railsrc__ as above, you could create
an app with the standard App Academy flags and add in `-G` by running

```sh
rails new my-app -G
```

Because of the `rc` file, that command will effectively expand to include the
`-T`, `--minimal`, and `-d=postgresql` flags in addition to the `-G` flag.

What if you then want to create an app that does use Unit Tests (i.e., no `-T`
flag)? Just tell Rails to skip the __~/.railsrc__ file by including the
`--no-rc` flag on the command line:

```sh
rails new my-app --no-rc --minimal -d=postgresql
```

## Setting options with other files

Typing three flags on the command line for every app is not so bad. Maybe it's
worth setting up an `rc` file for that, maybe not. Recognize, however, that
`--minimal` is actually doing a lot of work behind the scenes for you. That one
flag essentially expands into twelve additional ones:

```sh
--skip-action-cable
--skip-action-mailer
--skip-action-mailbox
--skip-action-text
--skip-active-job
--skip-active-storage
--skip-bootsnap
--skip-dev-gems
--skip-javascript
--skip-jbuilder
--skip-system-test
--skip-hotwire
```

Before Rails 6.1 introduced the `--minimal` flag, a programmer would have to
include all 12 of those flags on the command line to create an app as
streamlined as the apps you produce using `--minimal`. Now you can start to see
the real benefit to setting up a __~/.railsrc__ file.

What if you want to include Action Cable to enable chat in a few apps, however?
Then you couldn't use the `--minimal` flag because it would skip Action Cable.
You also wouldn't want to configure a __~/.railsrc__ file for just a few apps,
especially if you might be creating more standard apps in between. You could
simply type all of those flags (minus `--skip-action-cable`) onto the command
line, but Rails offers a better way: you can use any file as the effective `rc`
file.

You could accordingly copy all of the options above into a file--say,
__options.rc__ (you can name it anything you like; you don't even need the `.rc`
extension)--and delete `--skip-action-cable`. Then tell Rails to use that file
as the `rc` file using the `--rc` option:

```sh
rails new --rc=options.rc -d=postgresql -T
```

VoilÃ ! The command above will produce a Rails app equivalent to a `--minimal`
build with Action Cable added back in. The best part? You can reuse this
__options.rc__ file whenever you want to recreate this configuration.

> **Note:** This command assumes that __options.rc__ is in the directory where
> you are running `rails new`. If it is not, just provide the proper path. Also,
> Rails will recognize only one `rc` file per `new` command, so using the `--rc`
> flag will cause Rails to skip loading a __~/.railsrc__ file.

## What you have learned

In this reading, you learned how to set options for a new Rails app by
configuring an `rc` file, either the default __~/.railsrc__ or any other file
specified with the `--rc=<file_path>` command line option.
