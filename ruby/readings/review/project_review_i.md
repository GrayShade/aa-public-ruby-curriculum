## Afternoon Project Review

**Optional for Students who scored >= 90% on the last two assessments (including
practice assessments). If you are unsure of your percentage score on the last
two assessments consult a TA.**

Now is the time to review a project that confused or stumped you during the week
and attempt it **solo**. That's right - for the rest of day you'll be working
alone on the project you felt like you needed the most guidance on. Start your
chosen project from the beginning. Working on this the project solo will ensure
that you really understand each phase of that project. Ask your TA plenty of
questions to make sure understand all the elements of the project you've chosen.
