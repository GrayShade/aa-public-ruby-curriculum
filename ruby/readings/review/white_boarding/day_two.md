# White Boarding

Now you and your partner will get the chance to deepen your understanding of algorithms by participating in a programming tradition: white boarding! Though you will not have actual white boards the idea holds true. **NO CODE WILL BE RUN** during this white boarding session. All code will be written in a shared Markdown file. Start by creating a new file named `board.md`. This will be your white board. All code for this exercise will be written in that file and will **not** be run at any point while white boarding. The point of white boarding is testing not simply if you can write code, but if you can **understand** code.

Both partners will receive a set of questions and solutions for those questions. Partner A will switch off with Partner B asking one question at a time. The partner currently answering the question will make every attempt to answer the question while explaining their thought process. The other partner will only offer hints at a solution once the person answering has gotten completely stuck.

You'll find that having to explain the code you write will further deepen your understanding of that code. The solution either partner comes up with will probably be different than the provided solution and that is totally fine! Both partners can choose to go back and refactor the code they've written after all questions have been answered.

**Don't spend longer than 20 minutes per coding question.** Start a timer once the question has finished being read.

[Here][wb] are the files for Partner A and Partner B - choose a role and Partner A will be the first one to be asked a question.

Happy boarding!!
