## Review Day 2!

Today you'll have a chance to review everything you've learned in the past week.
This day will be broken up into two primary parts:

1. **WhiteBoarding In the Morning** (Non-Optional)
2. **Project Review in the Afternoon**

## Afternoon Project Review

**Optional for Students who scored >= 90% on the last two assessments (including
practice assessments). If you are unsure of your percentage score on the last
two assessments consult a TA.**

Now is the time to review a project that confused or stumped you during last
week and attempt it **solo**. That's right - for the rest of day you'll be
working alone on the project you felt like you needed the most guidance on.
Start your chosen project from the beginning. Working on this the project solo
will ensure that you really understand each phase of that project. Make sure to
ask your TA plenty of questions to make sure understand all the elements of the
project you've chosen.
