# JavaScript Project

The purpose of this project is to have something visually compelling, 
interactive, and user-friendly to impress recruiters and other non-technical 
people. You will show off your mastery of JavaScript and object-oriented design.

As the most open-ended portfolio project, this is also an opportunity practice
independence (with learning and debugging) and organization (with your code and
your time) by producing an original, solo project. These are skills that you can
bring up in interviews and which will benefit you throughout your software
engineering career.

Good luck, developers!
