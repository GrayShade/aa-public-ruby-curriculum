# JavaScript Project

The purpose of this project is to have something visually compelling, 
interactive, and user-friendly to impress recruiters and other non-technical 
people. You will show off your mastery of JavaScript and object-oriented design.

This project is also a learning opportunity. It is the first portfolio project
in the curriculum. Is is an opportunity for you to practice independence (with
learning and debugging) and organization (with your code and your time) by
producing an original project. This practice will pay off for your larger scale
projects in a few weeks.

Good luck, developers!
