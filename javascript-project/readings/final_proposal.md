# JavaScript Project Proposal

**Final proposals are due W9D4 at 9am**

If you haven't already, create a local and remote repo for your project. Your
proposal should be written in the __README.md__ of your project repo. You'll be
submitting your proposal by sharing the link to your GitHub repo.

## What to Include in Your Proposal

### Background

A 1-2 paragraph description of your project, providing the necessary context for
someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it does.

### Functionality & MVPs

Fill in this template:

In *{ project name }*, users will be able to:

- { *4-6 core features or functionalities of your project* }
- { *feature* }
- { *feature* }
- { *feature* }
- { *feature* }

In addition, this project will include:

- { *2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README* }
- { *other aspect of project* }
- { *other aspect of project* }

### Wireframes

Draw the layout of your project: the major sections of the game view, the chart
and its legend, the game controls and about me links, etc. This doesn't have to
be a fully detailed mockup; it can just be labeled boxes showing the layout of
your project. See the Sample Proposal for an example.

[Wireframe.cc][wireframe] is a great tool for quickly creating wireframes.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs

What technologies, libraries, and APIs will your project use? If you're building
a game, you might use native browser technology like the Canvas API, or you
might use a library like `three.js`. If you're doing data visualization, you
might use `d3` for rendering charts, and an API to fetch data.

If you're still deciding between a few different libraries or APIs, you can list
the ones you're considering, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

If your project needs a backend (see below), list that here as well.

### Implementation Timeline

Here you will detail what you hope to get done each day for this project. It
serves as a roadmap for the upcoming week. You'll have the following days to
work on this project:

- Friday Afternoon & Weekend
- Monday
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday Morning

It can be quite hard to estimate how long parts of your project might take.
Don't worry if you end up straying from this timeline; the goal is to have a
plan in place for what you'll do & in what order, and to have a tentative pace.

You should also be aware that presentations will be Thursday afternoon, and
deploying your project to GitHub Pages will take some time Thursday morning, so
don't plan much for that morning.
