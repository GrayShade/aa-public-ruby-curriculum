# Express Middleware

Middleware functions are a critical part of a robust Express server. This
reading will enable you to

* Explain how the request pipeline in an Express application consists of
  a series of middleware functions
* Integrate route-level and application-level middleware

## Anatomy of a middleware function

Express _middleware_ is kind of a misnomer: because of the "middle" in
"middleware", you might assume that middleware is anything that sits between the
client and the Express server. According to the [Express documentation on using
middleware], however, "An Express application is essentially a series of
middleware function calls." Let's dive into what this means.

In Express, a middleware function is a function that takes three arguments, in
this specific order:

1. `req`- the request object
2. `res`- the response object
3. `next`- according to the [Express documentation on using middleware]: "the
   next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle"

These arguments might seem a little familiar. Up to this point, you've been
handling all requests with a callback function that takes a `req` and `res`
argument. For example, consider the anonymous callback function in this route
handler:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

It takes `req` and `res` as the first two arguments. There is, in fact, an
optional `next` argument that could have been passed into this function as well;
`next` is not needed, however, because the callback completes the response. (The
`next` argument will be discussed in more depth later in this reading.)

## A series of middleware functions

As a reminder, the documentation describes "an Express application" as "a
**series** of middleware function calls." To explore what "series" means, let's
set up another middleware function to log the time of each request.

Remember, a middleware function takes three arguments: `req`, `res`, and `next`.
You can accordingly create a `logTime` middleware function that console logs the
current time formatted as an ISO string like this:

```js
const logTime = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Current time: ", new Date().toISOString());
  // Since no response has been returned yet, invoke the `next` function to
  // move on to the next middleware function.
  next();
};
```

Note that, at the end, the middleware function invokes `next`, which will
call the next middleware function.

To update the `app.get('/')` route so that it calls `logTime` before it invokes
the anonymous callback function that sends back "Hello World!", just add the
`logTime` middleware before the anonymous callback:

```js
app.get("/", logTime, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
  // Note: You do not need to invoke a `next` function because you have returned
  // a successful response, ending the middleware series.
});
```

Now when a user goes to `localhost:3000`, the following will happen:

1. A GET request is made to the "/" route of the Express server.
2. The route invokes `logTime` as its first middleware function. `logTime` logs
   the current time. It then invokes `next`, which calls the next
   middleware function.
3. The next middleware function in this example is the anonymous callback
   function that runs `res.send("Hello World!")`.

You can invoke as many middleware functions as you'd like. In addition, because
the `req` and `res` objects are passed through every middleware function, you
can store values in the `req` object for the next middleware function to use.

Let's explore this by creating another middleware function called
`passOnMessage`:

```js
const passOnMessage = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Passing on a message!");
  req.passedMessage = "Hello from passOnMessage!";
  next();
};
```

Let's also add this middleware function to the `app.get('/')` route and then
`console.log` the `req.passedMessage` in the anonymous callback:

```js
app.get("/", logTime, passOnMessage, (req, res) => {
  console.log("Passed Message: ", req.passedMessage);
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

> In the example above, `passedMessage` is added to the `req` object so that it
> can be used in a later middleware function. Alternatively, you might want to
> store properties inside of the [res.locals] object so that you don't
> accidentally override an existing property in the `req` object.

Instead of passing each middleware function in separate arguments, you can
also pass them as a single array argument:

```js
app.get("/", [logTime, passOnMessage], (req, res) => {
  console.log("Passed Message: ", req.passedMessage);
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

**The order matters.** If you change the order of the middleware functions
above, it will switch the order of the messages that are logged to the console
in `logTime` and `passOnMessage`, respectively.

## Integrating application-level middleware

To be clear, as implemented above, `logTime` and `passOnMessage` will be
executed only for the `app.get('/')` route. If, for example, you set up
another route:

```js
app.get("/bye", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Bye World.");
});
```

that `/bye` route would not invoke the `logTime` middleware function because it
(currently) does not receive `logTime` as one of its arguments. To fix this, you
could simply pass in the `logTime` middleware. If you wanted to execute
`logTime` for every single route, however, always having to add it as an
argument would quickly become tedious.

Setting up an application-level middleware function that runs for every single
route is simple. First, remove `logTime` from the `app.get('/')` argument list.
Then add it as an application-wide middleware by writing `app.use(logTime)`.
After doing this, an __app.js__ file might look like this:

```js
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

const logTime = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Current time: ", new Date().toISOString());
  next();
};

// `app.use(logTime)` installs `logTime` as an application-level middleware that
// will be invoked every time the app receives a request.
app.use(logTime);

const passOnMessage = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Passing on a message!");
  req.passedMessage = "Hello from passOnMessage!";
  next();
};

app.get("/", passOnMessage, (req, res) => {
  console.log("Passed Message: ", req.passedMessage);
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.get("/bye", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Bye World.");
});

// Define a port and start listening for connections.
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}...`));
```

Now whenever you navigate to either `localhost:3000` or `localhost:3000/bye`,
the `logTime` middleware function will be executed. `passOnMessage`, however,
will still be executed only for the `app.get('/')` route.
