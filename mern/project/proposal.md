# MERN Project

Now that you are acquainted with the MERN Stack, let's show potential employers
what you can build! Your job is now to build your own MERN application.

For the MERN project, you are required to work in a group of either 3 or 4
people. This project should be equivalent to the scale of your full stack
project but utilizing a unique idea of your own design. **This project should
not be a pixel perfect clone of an existing web app.** Propose a project that
requires sufficient skill to impress potential employers. Remember, you can
always choose to continue adding features during your job search. However, what
you turn in needs to be a complete MVP.

The key goal of the MERN project is show potential employers your versatility in
using different technologies. Also, since your project should be a somewhat
original idea, this project will help differentiate you from other App Academy
grads.

## MERN Pre-Proposal (Due: W14D5)

Because the MERN project is the first group project and also by far the
largest-scale project students build while at App Academy, it is extremely
important for you to invest heavily in the early planning stages.

Historically, there's a pretty strong correlation between how well developed the
project proposal is and how well the projects turn out. In addition, students
that don't actually sufficiently plan out a project often times don't meet the
project deadline, which can really hurt the start of your job search. Because of
this, on Friday (W14D5) you will work on drafting your proposal.

Your pre-proposal should contain:

- A list of team members on your project (3-4 people)
- A general idea of what you are trying to build, along with the core
  functionalities/features of your application.
  - Project Name
  - General Description
  - Feature List
- A couple backup ideas (no need to put too much time into this, unless you
  really don't like you first choice).

Each group will have an opportunity to talk to a TA about their proposal.
During this time, they'll receive feedback about their project as well as how
they should be spending their time over the weekend.

**Don't leave on W14D5 until your pre-proposal has been approved by a TA!**

## Flex (MERN) Project Proposal

### Due by 9AM W15D1

- The proposal should be written in Markdown as the README of your team's
  GitHub repo.
- To submit your proposal, slack one of your Instructors a link to your team's
  repo to **by 9AM W15D1.**
  - **Only one repo needed per team**
- Required sections (**each section will be its own heading**):
  - **Background and Overview**
  - **Functionality and MVP**
  - **Technologies and Technical Challenges**
    - Your proposal should anticipate potential roadblocks with the technologies
      you are planning to use. 
  - **Group Members and Work Breakdown**
    - Your proposal must have a day-by-day breakdown **for each individual.** 
      See sample proposal for clarification.

## Project Requirements

All projects need to have these elements:

- Live Hosted
- User Authentication
- 4 Distinct Features
  - At least one feature must be full a CRUD feature
- A Production README Due W16D1 - make sure it has:
  - Description of project, including goals
  - Link to live demo and/or instructions on how to use and run code
  - List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used (MERN and any other tech)
  - Technical implementation details for anything worth mentioning (basically
    anything you had to stop and think about before building)
    - Include links to the neatest parts of the code, or embed snippets
    - Include screenshots of anything that looks pretty
  - To-dos and future features
  - **NOTE:** Use your proposal README as the starting point and update it as you 
    move towards the completion of your project.

Make sure there are no __.DS_Store__ files, __node_modules__, __.env__ files,
etc., included in your remote repo.
- **Hint:** Add these large and/or sensitive files to your __.gitignore__.

### Group Projects

When working in a group, make sure to use an effective [GitHub workflow].

- Do your work on feature branches.
- Regularly rebase or merge main into a feature branch. (At the very least, do
  this before submitting your pull request and before merging in a feature
  branch.)
- When a feature is complete, submit a _pull request_ and assign it to a team
  member to review your code.
- Discuss the code and make any necessary changes. When the assigned team member
  approves the pull request, merge the feature branch into main.
