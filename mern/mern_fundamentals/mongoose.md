# Mongoose

Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Learning Goals

- Understand what Mongoose is
- Understand why you are using Mongoose

## What is Mongoose?

Mongoose provides an API to model the data in your database. You can think of it
as a NoSQL equivalent of an ORM. To relate it to a technology that you have used
before, Mongoose serves the same purpose for MongoDB that Active Record serves
for Rails.

## Why Mongoose?

You may recall that the MongoDB reading identified not needing an ORM as a
benefit of MongoDB. So why use Mongoose?

The main reason is to make it easier to transition from a relational database to
a non-relational database. Using Mongoose makes the workflow similar to what you
used during your Full Stack Project. You can define a schema to work with your
collections. More importantly, Mongoose gives you some nice methods to define
validations on your schema as well!

Just remember that it is not necessary to use Mongoose to do these things.
Mongoose just makes them a little easier to do.
