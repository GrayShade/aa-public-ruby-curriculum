# MERN Stack Curriculum

Welcome to the MERN Stack Curriculum! This course is designed to quickly get
your feet wet in a new stack of technologies. **You should work through this
course over the Week 14 Weekend. This means you should have it completed before
class on Week 15D1.** Overall, you should set aside 8 hours over your weekend to
work through this material so you comprehend it well enough to apply the
concepts during Week 15.

You'll learn:

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- NodeJS

You're already familiar with the frontend React/Redux that you'll utilize in
this course so you'll spend most of your time focusing on the new bits of your
backend: MongoDB and Express. You'll be writing JavaScript/JSON exclusively in
this course.

## The Goal

You'll be building out a basic Twitter-like application using the MERN stack.
You should write the code and build out the application from scratch. Don't just
copy and paste the code snippets; make sure you understand what each line is
doing. You'll want to leave this practice with a good grasp of the MERN stack,
because you'll have to create your own MERN project in Week 15 :). More on this
soon!
